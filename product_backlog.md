* Need 20-25 stories, which will give you and us an idea about the scope of the project.
* User stories should follow the format as taught in the lecture, along with proper acceptance criteria. For this stage, thereâ€™s no need to story point the stories and will be done in upcoming sprints.
* All user stories should be documented in JIRA.
* JIRA access should be provided to assigned TA before the sprint ends.
