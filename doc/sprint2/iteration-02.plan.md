### Goals and Tasks

- **Show % of Countries Visited:**  
  As an existing user, I want to be shown the percentage of countries I've visited so that I can track my progress and feel motivated to visit more places.

- **Mark Visited Countries on the Globe/Map:**  
  As an existing user, I would like to mark the countries I’ve visited on a world globe so that I can visualize my travel history in a fun way.

- **Basic Social Media Functionalities:**  
  As an existing user, I would like to create, share, and delete travel posts, as well as like, dislike, and comment on other users' posts, so that I can share my trip details as well as get insights from other users' trips.

- **Introduce Earning Points For Interacting With the App:** 
  Аs an existing user, I would like to earn points for each post I make about my travel experience and how many likes my posts get, so that I can level up and feel motivated to share my experiences with others in an interesting format.

- **Logout Functionality:** 
  As a logged in user, I would like to be able to log out of my account, so that I can login with another account and/or not worry that someone will use my account without me knowing.

### Artifacts

For the purpose of the presentation, one or more team members will share their screens and use their localhost on the up-to-date development branch to demonstrate our progress. We can also use Postman for more precise API calls if necessary.
