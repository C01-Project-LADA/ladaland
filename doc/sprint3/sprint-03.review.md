## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

* **When:** March 21, 2025
* **Where:** Online Meeting

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions That Turned Out Well

- All team members posted their daily updates and progress so that everyone was on the same page and aware of any blockers or pending tasks.
- Weekly virtual meetings were held to discuss the past week and plan the course of action for the coming week. These meetings were beneficial for discussing what went well, what could be improved, who would work on what and in which order, and clarifying our deliverable expectations for the week.
- Tasks were generally split based on developers' preferences. For example, some developers focused primarily on Core (backend) tasks while others chose to handle Client (frontend) tasks, aligning with their interests. This ensured that developers were more likely to enjoy working on their tasks, increasing the chances of tasks being completed well and delivered on time.

#### Decisions That Did Not Turn Out as Well as We Hoped

- The decision to do a bit of work every day for the project didn't go as smoothly as we thought. The team was very busy during the first part of the sprint due to other very heavy course work, so all members put most of their efforts near the end of the sprint.

#### Planned Changes

- We plan to work ahead of time in future sprints, so that we don't feel as rushed near the end of the sprint.

#### Goals and/or Tasks That Were Planned But Not Met/Completed
- **CLIENT Tickets for:**
  - Trip planning

  **Reasoning:** Client tickets have been very time-consuming; however, they rely heavily on the backend functionality being in place for integration purposes, so we feel comfortable being ahead on core work.

## Meeting Highlights

- We will focus primarily on finishing the social media aspect of the site. This decision was made due to the fact that we almost finished with this, and thus will hopefully not take too much time and resources in the future sprint. Also, setting up the social media functionalities is necessary for future tickets, such as rewarding users with points for posting/interacting with the app, which we will implement in the next sprint.
- We will also focus on polishing the frontend of our existing features to avoid building up an unnecessary tech debt backlog.
- We will set up Docker for future use to standardize as much of our team's workflow as possible. This will include establishing a method to ensure everyone's local database is populated with the correct data, such as visa requirement information.
