### Metrics for Measurement

- Each feature is associated with user stories that are divided into CORE and CLIENT tickets.

## Release Scope

### Included Features

  - **Existing Users:**  
    Users can log in with a unique username and secure password to track travel progress, points, leaderboard standings, and posts on LADA Land.

    Users can create an account using a unique username, secure password, email address, and an optional phone number.

  Existing users with multiple passports or a specific passport can view visa requirements for different countries to better plan their trips.

- **[CORE] AI Budget-Based Travel Suggestions:**  
  As an existing user, I would like to input my budget and receive travel suggestions so that I can explore options within my financial means.

- **[CORE] Show % of Countries Visited:**  
  As an existing user, I want to be shown the percentage of countries I've visited so that I can track my progress and feel motivated to visit more places.

- **[CORE] Mark Visited Countries on the Globe/Map:**

### Excluded Features

- CLIENT Tickets for:
  - AI Budget-Based Travel Suggestions
  - Show % of Countries Visited
  - Mark Visited Countries on the Globe/Map

  **Reasoning:** Client tickets have been very time consuming; however, they rely heavily on the backend functionality being put in place for integration purposes, so we feel comfortable being ahead on core work.

### Bug Fixes

- None

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**  
  Our site should load all pages within 2 seconds.
- **Security:**  
  We utilize Express Session to ensure security for our site and user authentication.
- **Usability:**  
  We are using the Shadcn/UI library along with a consistent color palette for consistency across the site in both style and feel.

### Dependencies and Limitations

- **External Dependencies:**  
  OpenAI API, Shadcn/UI, Radix
- **Known Limitations:**  
  The Visa Requirement Tool depends on a static CSV file that is imported into the database.

## Additional Organizational Considerations

### Deployment Instructions

*Note:* I would complete this section by ensuring there is a **very detailed** step-by-step instruction on how to perform each operation needed for deployment. Personally, I would see to it that deployment is as automated as possible due to human error risks.

1. **Pre-deployment Checks**
2. **Backup and Version Control**
3. **Deployment Execution Steps**
4. **Validation and Verification**

### Post Implementation Verification (PIV) Instructions

*Note:* I would complete this section by gathering acceptance criteria from our tickets and organizing the most important functionality into a test suite for testing in a UAT environment during a regression cycle prior to production release.

- **Verification Criteria:**  
  Outline key checks to confirm successful deployment.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  
  Describe procedures to ensure end-user validation.

### Post Deployment Monitoring

*Note:* I would fill this out with a list of tools we use for monitoring and a consistent, in-depth method for diagnosing and responding to high and low priority bugs.

- **Monitoring Tools:**  
  Utilize metrics and dashboards to track performance.
- **Error Handling:**  
  Establish a process for identifying and resolving issues.

### Rollback Strategy

*Note:* I would fill this out by clarifying what sort of bug or issue warrants a rollback and then providing step-by-step instructions on how this would be done. Similar to deployment, I would like this to be as automated as possible to avoid human error.

- **Rollback Triggers:**  
  Define conditions that warrant a rollback.
- **Rollback Steps:**  
  Provide a detailed guide for reverting to the previous version.
- **Impact Analysis:**  
  Analyze and document risks associated with a rollback.
