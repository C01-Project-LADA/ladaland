## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

* **When:** Feb 14, 2025
* **Where:** Online Meeting

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions That Turned Out Well

- All team members posted their daily updates and progress so that everyone was on the same page and aware of any blockers or pending tasks.
- Weekly virtual meetings were held to discuss the past week and plan the course of action for the coming week. These meetings were beneficial for discussing what went well, what could be improved, who would work on what and in which order, and clarifying our deliverable expectations for the week.
- Tasks were generally split based on developers' preferences. For example, some developers focused primarily on Core (backend) tasks while others chose to handle Client (frontend) tasks, aligning with their interests. This ensured that developers were more likely to enjoy working on their tasks, increasing the chances of tasks being completed well and delivered on time.

#### Decisions That Did Not Turn Out as Well as We Hoped

- Expecting to host our weekly sync meetings at the exact same time every week was a mistake since team members' plans vary.
- Strict requirements for PR naming conventions resulted in more hassle than needed and were eventually scrapped.

#### Planned Changes

- We will plan our weekly sync meetings more dynamically to avoid last-minute timing conflicts and better accommodate team members' varied schedules.

#### Goals and/or Tasks That Were Planned But Not Met/Completed

- **CLIENT Tickets for:**
  - AI Budget-Based Travel Suggestions
  - Show % of Countries Visited
  - Mark Visited Countries on the Globe/Map

  **Reasoning:** Client tickets have been very time-consuming; however, they rely heavily on the backend functionality being in place for integration purposes, so we feel comfortable being ahead on core work.

## Meeting Highlights

- We will focus primarily on the social media aspect of the site. This decision was made due to its atomic nature, meaning it can be completed in its entirety within one sprint without requiring significant inter-feature integration later on.
- We will also focus on polishing the frontend of our existing features to avoid building up an unnecessary tech debt backlog.
- We will set up Docker for future use to standardize as much of our team's workflow as possible. This will include establishing a method to ensure everyone's local database is populated with the correct data, such as visa requirement information.
